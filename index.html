      <h2>The Infinite Monkey Theorem</h2>
      <p>The infinite monkey theorem posits that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an
        infinite amount of time will eventually type any given text. The theorem is often used to illustrate concepts of
        probability and randomness, suggesting that given enough time, any outcome with a non-zero probability, however
        unlikely, will occur.</p>
      <p>
        Using this theorem we will explore how long it would take Riyen to type out his mind and why Riyen has not
        admitted that he likes Ria Jethwa.

      <h2>Calculation with a Full-Size QWERTY Keyboard</h2>
      <h3>Step-by-Step Calculation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Total Characters to Type:</strong>
          <p>The phrase "I like Ria Jethwa" is 17 characters long.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Typing Rate:</strong>
          <p>Lets propose that the monkey (Riyen) types at a rate of 4 characters per second.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Number of Keys:</strong>
          <p>For a full-size QWERTY keyboard, we assume there are 94 keys (letters, digits, punctuation, and other
            characters).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Probability of Typing the Phrase Correctly:</strong>
          <p>Each key press has a probability of <span>1/94</span> of being correct.</p>
          <p>For 17 characters, the probability of typing the phrase correctly in one attempt is:</p>
          <p>
            <span>(1/94)^17</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expected Number of Attempts:</strong>
          <p>The expected number of attempts to type the phrase correctly is the reciprocal of the probability:</p>
          <p>
            <span>94^17</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expected Time for One Attempt:</strong>
          <p>Each attempt to type 17 characters at a rate of 4 characters per second takes:</p>
          <p>
            <span>17 characters/4 characters/second = 4.25 seconds</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Total Expected Time:</strong>
          <p>The total expected time to type the phrase correctly is:</p>
          <p>
            <span>Expected number of attempts × Time per attempt = (94^17) × 4.25 seconds</span>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Calculation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Calculate (94^17):</strong>
          <p>
            <span>94^17 ≈ 1.5079 × 10^34</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multiply by 4.25 seconds:</strong>
          <p>
            <span>(1.5079 × 10^34) × 4.25 ≈ 6.4035 × 10^34 seconds</span>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Conversion to Years</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Seconds in a Year:</strong>
          <p>
            <span>60 × 60 × 24 × 365 ≈ 3.1536 × 10^7 seconds</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Convert Total Seconds to Years:</strong>
          <p>
            <span>6.4035 × 10^34 / 3.1536 × 10^7 ≈ 2.03 × 10^27 years</span>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The expected time for a monkey to type the phrase "I like Ria Jethwa" correctly at a rate of 4 characters per
        second on a full-size QWERTY keyboard is approximately <strong>2.03 × 10^27</strong> years. This incredibly vast
        time frame underscores the impracticality of relying on random typing to achieve specific text outcomes.</p>
